## Content

This deck features more than 6,000 geography cards, including countries, autonomous regions, subdivisions and more. 
Each note contains several cards, allowing you to learn information about each place : Flag, Coat of arms, Map, Capital and Main City (if different).
Additional information (IPA pronunciation, local name, languages etc) can also be found, and are summed up in the "show more" button on  the back of the cards.

The deck currently features every countries (fully recognized or not) as well as most of the first-level subdivisions for Europe and America, and several other on the other continents. My goal is to ultimately add every country, it's still in progress.

## How to use

-	There is a tag for each type of territory, allowing to learn only specific countries if needed. For instance, you can filter with "geosiwk::Canada", if you only want the canadian provinces.

-	In the case where the flag is a banner of arms (ie very similar to the coat of arms), the card is tagged with the "geosiwk::BannerOfArms" tag. When the flag is just the coat of arms on a plain field, it is also tagged as "geosiwk::Identical"

-	Similarly, when the territory and the capital have the same name, it is tagged with "geosiwk::Eponymous" 

-	Every name is written in its local language, and  the "traduction" button on the front of the cards allows to see the english name. If this bothers you, simply switch the "placeEng" and "placeOri" fields on the cards (same thing for capitals and main cities).

-	Many territories display several flags and coats of arms, because the deck includes variations (ie civil flags, state flags, naval ensigns etc). The flag located in the "flag1" field is always the mainly used one, so you can suspend the other cards if you feel like you don't need them.



## License

All the flags displayed here were taken from wikimedia, under the creative commons license. The sources should be linked in each notes. I edited some of those flags when they displayed the name of the region. 
The maps are made using QGIS, with data from Natural Earth (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) and GADM (https://gadm.org/).
I'm working on replacing them, but some maps are made using mapchart.net, also under creative commons. They should all include the watermark.


## Contact

The deck is still a work in progress, and I'm always fixing and adding things. However, if you spot a mistake or want to contact me for any reason, use the ankiweb comments, or the github support page.
